# VDC-Genesis — The First Thermodynamically Constrained Digital Asset
**Proof-of-Motion Monetary Primitive | November 2025**

## 📌 Genesis Supply (permanently fixed)
`5,238.6952936057 VDC`

## 🔥 Backing Data
- 1,317,977.08 kcal ActiveEnergyBurned (Apple Health verified)  
- 5.514 × 10¹² Joules of human mechanical work  
- Emission constant: α = 0.95 × 10⁻⁶ VDC/J (immutable)  
- 733 parsed GPX workout routes  
- Peak recorded velocity: **112.94 m/s** (consumer wearable saturation ceiling)  
- 3,114 confirmed VFS-01 velocity-fold events

## 🔗 Immutable Proofs
- Bitcoin OpenTimestamps (.ots files in repo)  
- GitHub commit SHA-256 history  
- Zero-dependency extractor runs in <9 minutes on any machine

This is the first monetary unit in history whose total possible supply is biologically and thermodynamically capped at ~41 billion VDC (all future human mechanical work combined).
